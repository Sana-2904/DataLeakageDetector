# DataLeakageDetector
Purpose :

These systems typically operate by:

Content scanning: Analyzing data in motion (network traffic), at rest (stored files), and in use (active applications) to identify sensitive information patterns

Policy enforcement: Applying predefined rules about what constitutes sensitive data and where it can or cannot go

Pattern recognition: Using techniques like regular expressions, machine learning, and fingerprinting to detect sensitive data formats (credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc.)

Contextual analysis: Evaluating the circumstances around data movement, such as user permissions, destination locations, and timing

Key Features :

Real-time monitoring: Continuous surveillance of data flows across networks, endpoints, and cloud services

Content classification: Automatic identification and categorization of sensitive data types

Policy management: Customizable rules for different data types and business requirements

Incident response: Alerting, logging, and sometimes automatically blocking suspicious data transfers
Reporting and analytics: Detailed insights into data usage patterns and potential risks
